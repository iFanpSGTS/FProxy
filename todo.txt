############### Traffic Analyzer TODO ###################
Suspicious User Agents:
Bots or malicious tools often use identifiable or generic user-agent strings (e.g., curl, Python-requests, etc.).
Rate of Requests:
High-frequency requests from the same IP may indicate a brute-force attack or web scraping.

Suspicious Query Parameters:
Parameters containing SQL, XSS payloads, or unexpected encodings might signify injection attempts (e.g., ' OR 1=1, <script>, etc.)

Unusual HTTP Methods:
Unexpected methods like TRACE, OPTIONS, or DELETE could indicate malicious probing.

Invalid or Missing Headers:
Headers like Host, Referer, or Content-Type being invalid or missing may indicate tampering.

Known Bad IP Addresses:
Requests from IPs flagged in threat intelligence feeds or blacklists.
Malformed or Unexpected Payloads:
POST data containing unexpected or overly long fields may indicate buffer overflow or injection attacks.

Request Timing and Distribution:
Requests at odd times or from geographically implausible locations for the user.

Techniques for Malicious Pattern Detection:
Signature-Based Detection:
Match known attack patterns using regex or predefined rules.

Anomaly-Based Detection:
Monitor baseline traffic and flag significant deviations.

Threat Intelligence Integration:
Use databases of malicious IPs, user agents, or URLs for real-time detection.

Behavioral Analysis:
Identify behavior patterns like repetitive requests or bot-like navigation.
